                Mozart c. 1780, detail from portrait by Johann Nepomuk della Croce Signature
                Anonymous portrait of the child Mozart, possibly by Pietro Antonio Lorenzoni; painted in 1763 on
                commission from Leopold Mozart
                Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart[a] (27 January 1756 â€“ 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus
                Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart,[b] was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period.
                Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on
                keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17,
                Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a
                better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to
                stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in
                Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the
                Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances
                of his death have been much mythologized.
                He composed more than 600 works, many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante,
                chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is considered among the greatest classical composers of all
                time,[1][2] and his influence on Western music is profound. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early
                works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: "posterity will not see such a talent again in
                100 years".[3]
